Add a Buy It Installed Button on your woocommerce store.

== Description ==

The Buy It Installed plugin gives your customers the option to order products and have them installed by a certified professional. When customers choose the Buy It Installed option, the product is bundled with installation in their shopping cart. This is an easily-integrated way to provide installation for your products. 

== Installation ==

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New. In the search field type 'Woocommerce bii' and click Search Plugins. Once you have found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here. (http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
